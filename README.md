# Cellebrite CTF 2024 Writeup

## Overview

This repository documents the forensic analysis conducted on four datasets belonging to four fictional individuals (Felix, Sharon, Otto, and Russell). The analysis was carried out as part of the **Cellebrite Digital Forensics CTF 2024**, held from **October 15, 2024, to October 22, 2024**, with the objective of answering a series of specific questions for each dataset.

## Tools and Methodologies

The analysis was performed using the following tools:
- **Cellebrite Inseyets Physical Analyzer v. 10.3.0.3169** (Trial license granted during the competition)
- **DB Browser for SQLite**
- **ileappGUI**
- **aleappGUI**
- **Realm Studio**

Some questions were either left unanswered due to insufficient data or could be answered directly through straightforward interaction with Cellebrite Physical Analyzer's graphical user interface (GUI), which did not require a detailed explanation.

All timestamps in this repository are expressed in **UTC** format (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`), unless explicitly requested in local time by the original questions.

## Challenges Faced

During the competition, several challenges were encountered:
- Interpreting and managing large volumes of unstructured and complex data.
- Linking fragmented pieces of information from diverse sources to answer nuanced questions.
- Collaborating as a team to adapt investigative strategies dynamically based on the findings.

These challenges were addressed with a methodical approach, leveraging a variety of tools and maintaining constant collaboration among team members. This experience not only strengthened our analytical and problem-solving skills but also enriched our knowledge base for future forensic investigations.

Thanks to the hard work and dedication of the team, we achieved **16th place**, a result that we're proud of since it was our first CTF.
We look forward to next year's competition, hoping we could achieve a higher position.
